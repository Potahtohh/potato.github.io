                <strong>Technology</strong> is known as the application of scientific knowledge to
                 the practical goals of human existence. It has helped humans advance in every sector and
                every field all over the world. Technology is constantly changing and evolving every aspect
                of our lives. We are living in the world of technology as almost everything is dependent
                on technology. It covers every aspect of our lives. Without the advancement of technology,
                the revolution of the world and the human race would have fallen behind than where it 
                actually is currently. Everything from the food we eat to the clothes we wear is related
                to technology in one way or the other. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Technology has become an inseparable part of our daily lives. The world of technology,
                as annoying as it can be at times, serves an important role in linking us to social 
                support, news and information, government services, banking, health resources, shopping,
                literature, entertainment, and learning tools. Despite the physical, economic, and
                psychological drawbacks of using technology, there is a clear advantage for everyone
                of us to actively investigate and use digital technologies.

            </p>

            <p>
                Technology has not only changed the physical components of our lives, but also changed our
                perceptions about the world through digital technology. The impact of social media all over 
                the world is something no one could have imagined 30 years ago. Technology has its effect on 
                people, especiallly the younger generations and children who are born into this world of
                technology. There can be both good and bad effects of technology.

                        Technology, like anything else, has both beneficial and harmful effects. Our lives have
                        been made so much easier by the smartphone revolution, but it has also made us so sluggish.
                        At the present, the entire world is at our fingertips, yet we don't even want to get out
                        of bed. Our sedentary lifestyle and lack of physical exercises demonstrate our reliance
                        on smartphones. The younger generation, in particular, appears to be addicted to their
                        phones. Cell phone addiction has a severe influence on our lives in the present day.

                        Similary, the field of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics is also developing at a
                        rapid pace. In the 21st century, AI is the next step of development in technology. 
                        Tech giants like Google and Tesla are constantly working in the advancement of 
                        technology through Artificial Inelligence. Although the idea of AI seems cool at the 
                        first glance, it also has its own set of drawbacks. Implementation of Artificial 
                        Intelligence and Robotics in our daily lives is expected to cause massive amount of 
                        unemployment as the need of human resources in each field will grow less and less 
                        gradually as almost everything a man can do, AI could be able to do better. Although
                        the development of AI has not had that level of progress, we can still expect it to 
                        alter our lives in the near future.

                Like everything, technlology also has two sides to it. There cannot be good without the bad. 
                On the one hand, it aided us in making significant progress. It led us to the furthest reaches
                of space and the deepest reaches of the ocean, and it aided us in the construction of huge 
                cities and efficient transportation systems. On the other hand, it enabled the development
                of nuclear and hydrogen bombs, as well as increased pollution and the emergence of new 
                terrible illnesses. There is little doubt that technology will continue to dominate our
                lives.  Future technology will undoubtedly impact our lives in extraordinary ways. 
                It is obvious that excellent, regulated technology delivers positive outcomes, whereas bad,
                uncontrolled technology produces disastrous ones.
